#' Convert between dates and epidemiological weeks/years.
#'
#' epical allows you to calculate back and forth between epidemiological weeks
#' and calendar dates.
#'
#' Epidemiological weeks, also called "epi-weeks", "epi weeks", or "MMWR weeks"
#' are a standardized method of assigning days to a week of the year.
#' Epidemiological weeks are used by the WHO, CDC, and many other health
#' organizations.
#'
#' The WHO defines epidemiological weeks as starting on a Monday and ending on a
#' Sunday. The CDC defines epidemiological weeks as starting on a Sunday and
#' ending on a Saturday. In either case, the end of the first epidemiological
#' week of the year by definition must fall at least four days into the year. In
#' other words, the first epidemiological week always begins on a date between
#' December 29 and January 4.
#'
#' Every date can be assigned to a 7-day-long epidemiological week. Most years
#' have 52 epidemiological weeks, but some have 53.
#'
#' Because some dates in epidemiological week 1 can fall within the previous
#' calendar year, and dates in epidemiological week 52/53 can fall within the
#' subsequent calendar year, it is necessary to specify both the epidemiological
#' week number and an "epidemiological year" so that dates can be grouped
#' correctly by year.
#'
#' To determine which epi-week a calendar date falls in, use
#' \code{\link{epi_week}}.
#'
#' To add columns for epi-week and epi-year to a data frame with a date column,
#' use \code{\link{add_epi_week}}.
#'
#' To determine the start date of an epi-week or epi-year, use
#' \code{\link{epi_week_date}} or \code{\link{epi_year_start}}.

#' Date Conversion to Epidemiological Weeks
#'
#' Function to calculate the epidemiological weeks in which one or more calendar
#' dates fall.
#'
#' The function first converts \code{date} to a \code{Date} object using the
#' function \code{as.Date()}. I welcome suggestions for making this more robust.
#'
#' @param x A Date vector, or another vector that can be converted to Date using
#' \code{as.Date}
#' @param system Either "who" or "cdc". WHO epidemiological weeks start on
#' Monday. CDC epidemiological weeks (MMWR weeks) start on Sunday
#' @param ... Additional parameters passed to \code{as.Date}
#' @return A data frame with columns labeled \code{epi_week} and
#' \code{epi_year}. The object also has class tbl_df and tbl for use with the
#' \code{dplyr} package.

#' @examples
#' epi_week("2015-01-01")

#' Date Conversion from Epidemiological Weeks
#'
#' Function to calculate dates from epidemiological weeks.
#'
#' This function determines the date of the first day of each epi-week,

#' week, or any other arbitrary amount.

#' \code{epi_week} and \code{epi_year} are recycled if necessary.
#'
#' @param epi_week An object that can be coerced to a \code{numeric}
#' @param epi_year An object that can be coerced to a \code{numeric}
#' @param offset A number of days to offset the returned dates by. The default
#' is 0 in which case the function returns the date of the first day of each
#' epi week. An offset of 6 would instead return the date of the last day of
#' each epi week.
#' @param system Either "who" or "cdc". Defauly is "who".
#' See \code{\link{epi_week}} for details.
#' @return A \code{Date} vector
